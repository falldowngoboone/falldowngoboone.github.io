      <h3>Ocotober 2015–Present</h3>
      <p>Owner/Freelance Web Developer and Designer</p>
      <p>fall down go boone <em>Fort Worth, TX</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Built a custom website for a <a href="http://olive-thebeautylounge.com" target="_blank">small business in Mansfield, TX</a></li>
        <li>Interviewed the customer and established business needs and solutions</li>
        <li>Executed the solution by creating a custom WordPress theme complete with WooCommerce, Google Maps, and other various service API integrations</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="projects">Side Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="" target="_blank">Lists App</a></h3>
      <p>A React/Redux client-based project tracking app intended for management use to track the progress of several designers department wide</p>

      <h4>Project Goals</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Gain basic UX experience by interviewing potential users and testing possible solutions</li>
        <li>Establish a firm foundation in React</li>
        <li>Understand the philosophy of the Redux version of Flow</li>
        <li>Create a web-based app through a holistic design and development approach</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Current Status</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Still in development/early real-world use</li>
        <li>Initial app API is complete</li>
        <li>Currently designing and developing UI</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>What I've Learned So Far</h4>
      <p>Throughout this project I've been able to become more acquainted with test-driven development using Mocha and the Expect library, particularly the difficulties of knowing what to test for and how to maintain tests over the build process. I've also become more comfortable with Webpack, React, and Redux.</p>
      <p>Outside of programming and workflow experience, I've also discovered the complexities of API design. APIs need to be easy to understand yet powerful enough to allow developers to scale. I look forward to growing in the area of software architecture design.</p>

      <h3><a href="" target="_blank">Hotsheet</a></h3>
      <p>A personal project tracker and to-do list built in Angular 1.x and PHP.</p>

      <h4>Project Goals</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a project that depends on a common JavaScript framework</li>
        <li>Create a useful, web-based replacement to handwritten to-do lists</li>
        <li>Eliminate repetitive, hand-typed daily emails to management</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Current Status</h4>
      <p>In real-world, daily use.</p>
      <h4>What I Learned</h4>
      <p>This was the first big JavaScript project I had ever undertaken that was not a guided tutorial. Perhaps Angular 1.x was not a good starting place, but I learned how little I understood about JavaScript, as well as how difficult building just a simple framework-based web app really was. I learned about the tradeoffs made between custom code and off-the-shelf solutions. This project served as the basis for future JavaScript study.</p>

      <h3><a href="http://www.falldowngoboone.com" target="_blank">fall down go boone</a></h3>
      <p>Personal blog.</p>

      <h4>Project Goals</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn to communicate ideas efficiently and effectively</li>
        <li>Establish an online presence</li>
        <li>Have a personal sandbox in which to play</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Current Status</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Currently inactive</li>
        <li>I eventually plan to redesign and move from Wordpress to a static site generator</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>What I learned</h4>
      <p>I appreciate the opportunity to share ideas, but I felt in the end that all I was doing was repeating information that someone else said better elsewhere. I have since thought about using this space as a way to communicate some of the discoveries I've had while transitioning from a designer to a developer. I'm still exploring a content strategy. And there's always Medium!</p>
